mean total number of steps taken per day:
```{r}
    mean(total_steps$steps)
```
median of the total number of steps taken
```{r}
median(total_steps$steps)
```
#2. Average daily activity pattern 
```{r}

```

Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?
```{r}
    avg_daily_activity[which.max(avg_daily_activity$mean),]$interval
```
#3. Filling missing values
```{r}
    sum(is.na(activity$steps))
```
```{r}
   missing <- avg_daily_activity$mean[match(activity$interval, avg_daily_activity$interval)]
```

```{r}
    activity_imputed <- transform(activity, steps = ifelse(is.na(activity$steps), yes = missing, no = activity$steps))
total_steps_imputed <- aggregate(steps ~ date, activity_imputed, sum)
names(total_steps_imputed) <- c("date", "daily_steps")
```

plotting the histogram

```{r}
    hist(total_steps_imputed$daily_steps, col = "IndianRed", xlab = "Total steps per day", ylim = c(0,30), main = "Total number of steps taken each day", breaks = seq(0,25000,by=2500))
```

mean of total number of steps taken per day
```{r}
    mean(total_steps_imputed$daily_steps)
```
median of total steps taken per day
```{r}
    median(total_steps_imputed$daily_steps)
```
#4. finding differences in acticity patterns between weekdays and weekends 

```{r}
    activity$date <- as.Date(strptime(activity$date, format="%Y-%m-%d"))
activity$datetype <- sapply(activity$date, function(x) {
        if (weekdays(x) == "SÃ¡bado" | weekdays(x) =="Domingo") 
                {y <- "Weekend"} else 
                {y <- "Weekday"}
